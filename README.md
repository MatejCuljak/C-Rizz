Rev.: 1.0.0; The living standard.

A bussin language addition for brain ded gen-z C programmers. Inspired by [PyGyat](https://github.com/shamith09/pygyat).

This language is shown to 10x your development.

Also, new employers will have a huge pool of new low-wage slaves, cough, cough, workers since all the TikTokers need to spend their newfound attention on something new!

> DO NOT CONFUSE THIS PROJECT WITH JAVASCRIPT! They are not the same, JS is way worse.

I'm also considering doing an C3 compatible extension. So we can add keywords like: `await` `holdUp`...

> Why on earth would I create this? Well, to attract new talent.

Now you can make low-level programming and systems development even more complicated with this little gem. Looking forward to your use cases! 



‚ö° Getting Started
-----------------

üì¶ Please check that you have the following dependencies installed:
- `criz.h`
- any C compiler

‚¨áÔ∏è Clone this repository to your machine. `git clone https://github.com/MatejCuljak/C-Rizz`

Include the `criz.h` header file in your project and enjoy your brain rot develop beyond a reversible stage.
